    <p class="Titlu" id="toc_marker-13">IVY DAY IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM</p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-3">OLD JACK</span> <span class="char-style-override-4">raked the cinders together with a piece of cardboard and spread them judiciously over the whitening dome of coals. When the dome was thinly covered his face lapsed into darkness but, as he set himself to fan the fire again, his crouching shadow ascended the opposite wall and his face slowly re-emerged into light. It was an old man’s face, very bony and hairy. The moist blue eyes blinked at the fire and the moist mouth fell open at times, munching once or twice mechanically when it closed. When the cinders had caught he laid the piece of cardboard against the wall, sighed and said:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“That’s better now, Mr. O’Connor.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. O’Connor, a grey-haired young man, whose face was disfigured by many blotches and pimples, had just brought the tobacco for a cigarette into a shapely cylinder but when spoken to he undid his handiwork meditatively. Then he began to roll the tobacco again meditatively and after a moment’s thought decided to lick the paper.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Did Mr. Tierney say when he’d be back?” he asked in a husky falsetto.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“He didn’t say.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. O’Connor put his cigarette into his mouth and began search his pockets. He took out a pack of thin pasteboard cards.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I’ll get you a match,” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Never mind, this’ll do,” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He selected one of the cards and read what was printed on it:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">MUNICIPAL ELECTIONS</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">ROYAL EXCHANGE WARD</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Richard J. Tierney, P.L.G., respectfully solicits the favour of your vote and influence at the coming election in the Royal Exchange Ward.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. O’Connor had been engaged by Tierney’s agent to canvass one part of the ward but, as the weather was inclement and his boots let in the wet, he spent a great part of the day sitting by the fire in the Committee Room in Wicklow Street with Jack, the old caretaker. They had been sitting thus since the short day had grown dark. It was the sixth of October, dismal and cold out of doors.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. O’Connor tore a strip off the card and, lighting it, lit his cigarette. As he did so the flame lit up a leaf of dark glossy ivy the lapel of his coat. The old man watched him attentively and then, taking up the piece of cardboard again, began to fan the fire slowly while his companion smoked.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Ah, yes,” he said, continuing, “it’s hard to know what way to bring up children. Now who’d think he’d turn out like that! I sent him to the Christian Brothers and I done what I could for him, and there he goes boosing about. I tried to make him someway decent.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He replaced the cardboard wearily.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Only I’m an old man now I’d change his tune for him. I’d take the stick to his back and beat him while I could stand over him&mdash;as I done many a time before. The mother, you know, she cocks him up with this and that....”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“That’s what ruins children,” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“To be sure it is,” said the old man. “And little thanks you get for it, only impudence. He takes th’upper hand of me whenever he sees I’ve a sup taken. What’s the world coming to when sons speaks that way to their father?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What age is he?” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Nineteen,” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Why don’t you put him to something?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Sure, amn’t I never done at the drunken bowsy ever since he left school? ‘I won’t keep you,’ I says. ‘You must get a job for yourself.’ But, sure, it’s worse whenever he gets a job; he drinks it all.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. O’Connor shook his head in sympathy, and the old man fell silent, gazing into the fire. Someone opened the door of the room and called out:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Hello! Is this a Freemasons’ meeting?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Who’s that?” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What are you doing in the dark?” asked a voice.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Is that you, Hynes?” asked Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Yes. What are you doing in the dark?” said Mr. Hynes. advancing into the light of the fire.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He was a tall, slender young man with a light brown moustache. Imminent little drops of rain hung at the brim of his hat and the collar of his jacket-coat was turned up.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Well, Mat,” he said to Mr. O’Connor, “how goes it?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. O’Connor shook his head. The old man left the hearth and, after stumbling about the room returned with two candlesticks which he thrust one after the other into the fire and carried to the table. A denuded room came into view and the fire lost all its cheerful colour. The walls of the room were bare except for a copy of an election address. In the middle of the room was a small table on which papers were heaped.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Hynes leaned against the mantelpiece and asked:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Has he paid you yet?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Not yet,” said Mr. O’Connor. “I hope to God he’ll not leave us in the lurch tonight.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Hynes laughed.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, he’ll pay you. Never fear,” he said.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I hope he’ll look smart about it if he means business,” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What do you think, Jack?” said Mr. Hynes satirically to the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The old man returned to his seat by the fire, saying:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“It isn’t but he has it, anyway. Not like the other tinker.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What other tinker?” said Mr. Hynes.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Colgan,” said the old man scornfully.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“It is because Colgan’s a working-man you say that? What’s the difference between a good honest bricklayer and a publican&mdash;eh? Hasn’t the working-man as good a right to be in the Corporation as anyone else&mdash;ay, and a better right than those shoneens that are always hat in hand before any fellow with a handle to his name? Isn’t that so, Mat?” said Mr. Hynes, addressing Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I think you’re right,” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“One man is a plain honest man with no hunker-sliding about him. He goes in to represent the labour classes. This fellow you’re working for only wants to get some job or other.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Of course, the working-classes should be represented,” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“The working-man,” said Mr. Hynes, “gets all kicks and no halfpence. But it’s labour produces everything. The working-man is not looking for fat jobs for his sons and nephews and cousins. The working-man is not going to drag the honour of Dublin in the mud to please a German monarch.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“How’s that?” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Don’t you know they want to present an address of welcome to Edward Rex if he comes here next year? What do we want kowtowing to a foreign king?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Our man won’t vote for the address,” said Mr. O’Connor. “He goes in on the Nationalist ticket.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Won’t he?” said Mr. Hynes. “Wait till you see whether he will or not. I know him. Is it Tricky Dicky Tierney?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“By God! perhaps you’re right, Joe,” said Mr. O’Connor. “Anyway, I wish he’d turn up with the spondulics.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The three men fell silent. The old man began to rake more cinders together. Mr. Hynes took off his hat, shook it and then turned down the collar of his coat, displaying, as he did so, an ivy leaf in the lapel.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“If this man was alive,” he said, pointing to the leaf, “we’d have no talk of an address of welcome.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“That’s true,” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Musha, God be with them times!” said the old man. “There was some life in it then.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The room was silent again. Then a bustling little man with a snuffling nose and very cold ears pushed in the door. He walked over quickly to the fire, rubbing his hands as if he intended to produce a spark from them.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“No money, boys,” he said.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Sit down here, Mr. Henchy,” said the old man, offering him his chair.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, don’t stir, Jack, don’t stir,” said Mr. Henchy</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He nodded curtly to Mr. Hynes and sat down on the chair which the old man vacated.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Did you serve Aungier Street?” he asked Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Yes,” said Mr. O’Connor, beginning to search his pockets for memoranda.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Did you call on Grimes?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I did.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Well? How does he stand?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“He wouldn’t promise. He said: ‘I won’t tell anyone what way I’m going to vote.’ But I think he’ll be all right.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Why so?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“He asked me who the nominators were; and I told him. I mentioned Father Burke’s name. I think it’ll be all right.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Henchy began to snuffle and to rub his hands over the fire at a terrific speed. Then he said:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“For the love of God, Jack, bring us a bit of coal. There must be some left.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The old man went out of the room.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“It’s no go,” said Mr. Henchy, shaking his head. “I asked the little shoeboy, but he said: ‘Oh, now, Mr. Henchy, when I see work going on properly I won’t forget you, you may be sure.’ Mean little tinker! ‘Usha, how could he be anything else?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What did I tell you, Mat?” said Mr. Hynes. “Tricky Dicky Tierney.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, he’s as tricky as they make ‘em,” said Mr. Henchy. “He hasn’t got those little pigs’ eyes for nothing. Blast his soul! Couldn’t he pay up like a man instead of: ‘O, now, Mr. Henchy, I must speak to Mr. Fanning.... I’ve spent a lot of money’? Mean little school-boy of hell! I suppose he forgets the time his little old father kept the hand-me-down shop in Mary’s Lane.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“But is that a fact?” asked Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“God, yes,” said Mr. Henchy. “Did you never hear that? And the men used to go in on Sunday morning before the houses were open to buy a waistcoat or a trousers&mdash;moya! But Tricky Dicky’s little old father always had a tricky little black bottle up in a corner. Do you mind now? That’s that. That’s where he first saw the light.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The old man returned with a few lumps of coal which he placed here and there on the fire.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Thats a nice how-do-you-do,” said Mr. O’Connor. “How does he expect us to work for him if he won’t stump up?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I can’t help it,” said Mr. Henchy. “I expect to find the bailiffs in the hall when I go home.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Hynes laughed and, shoving himself away from the mantelpiece with the aid of his shoulders, made ready to leave.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“It’ll be all right when King Eddie comes,” he said. “Well boys, I’m off for the present. See you later. ‘Bye, ‘bye.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He went out of the room slowly. Neither Mr. Henchy nor the old man said anything, but, just as the door was closing, Mr. O’Connor, who had been staring moodily into the fire, called out suddenly:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“’Bye, Joe.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Henchy waited a few moments and then nodded in the direction of the door.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Tell me,” he said across the fire, “what brings our friend in here? What does he want?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“’Usha, poor Joe!” said Mr. O’Connor, throwing the end of his cigarette into the fire, “he’s hard up, like the rest of us.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Henchy snuffled vigorously and spat so copiously that he nearly put out the fire, which uttered a hissing protest.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“To tell you my private and candid opinion,” he said, “I think he’s a man from the other camp. He’s a spy of Colgan’s, if you ask me. Just go round and try and find out how they’re getting on. They won’t suspect you. Do you twig?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Ah, poor Joe is a decent skin,” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“His father was a decent, respectable man,” Mr. Henchy admitted. “Poor old Larry Hynes! Many a good turn he did in his day! But I’m greatly afraid our friend is not nineteen carat. Damn it, I can understand a fellow being hard up, but what I can’t understand is a fellow sponging. Couldn’t he have some spark of manhood about him?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“He doesn’t get a warm welcome from me when he comes,” said the old man. “Let him work for his own side and not come spying around here.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I don’t know,” said Mr. O’Connor dubiously, as he took out cigarette-papers and tobacco. “I think Joe Hynes is a straight man. He’s a clever chap, too, with the pen. Do you remember that thing he wrote...?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Some of these hillsiders and fenians are a bit too clever if you ask me,” said Mr. Henchy. “Do you know what my private and candid opinion is about some of those little jokers? I believe half of them are in the pay of the Castle.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“There’s no knowing,” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, but I know it for a fact,” said Mr. Henchy. “They’re Castle hacks.... I don’t say Hynes.... No, damn it, I think he’s a stroke above that.... But there’s a certain little nobleman with a cock-eye&mdash;you know the patriot I’m alluding to?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. O’Connor nodded.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“There’s a lineal descendant of Major Sirr for you if you like! O, the heart’s blood of a patriot! That’s a fellow now that’d sell his country for fourpence&mdash;ay&mdash;and go down on his bended knees and thank the Almighty Christ he had a country to sell.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">There was a knock at the door.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Come in!” said Mr. Henchy.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">A person resembling a poor clergyman or a poor actor appeared in the doorway. His black clothes were tightly buttoned on his short body and it was impossible to say whether he wore a clergyman’s collar or a layman’s, because the collar of his shabby frock-coat, the uncovered buttons of which reflected the candlelight, was turned up about his neck. He wore a round hat of hard black felt. His face, shining with raindrops, had the appearance of damp yellow cheese save where two rosy spots indicated the cheekbones. He opened his very long mouth suddenly to express disappointment and at the same time opened wide his very bright blue eyes to express pleasure and surprise.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O Father Keon!” said Mr. Henchy, jumping up from his chair. “Is that you? Come in!”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, no, no, no!” said Father Keon quickly, pursing his lips as if he were addressing a child.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Won’t you come in and sit down?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“No, no, no!” said Father Keon, speaking in a discreet, indulgent, velvety voice. “Don’t let me disturb you now! I’m just looking for Mr. Fanning....”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“He’s round at the Black Eagle,” said Mr. Henchy. “But won’t you come in and sit down a minute?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“No, no, thank you. It was just a little business matter,” said Father Keon. “Thank you, indeed.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He retreated from the doorway and Mr. Henchy, seizing one of the candlesticks, went to the door to light him downstairs.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, don’t trouble, I beg!”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“No, but the stairs is so dark.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“No, no, I can see.... Thank you, indeed.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Are you right now?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“All right, thanks.... Thanks.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Henchy returned with the candlestick and put it on the table. He sat down again at the fire. There was silence for a few moments.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Tell me, John,” said Mr. O’Connor, lighting his cigarette with another pasteboard card.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Hm?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What he is exactly?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Ask me an easier one,” said Mr. Henchy.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Fanning and himself seem to me very thick. They’re often in Kavanagh’s together. Is he a priest at all?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Mmmyes, I believe so.... I think he’s what you call a black sheep. We haven’t many of them, thank God! but we have a few.... He’s an unfortunate man of some kind....”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“And how does he knock it out?” asked Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“That’s another mystery.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Is he attached to any chapel or church or institution or&mdash;&mdash;s”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“No,” said Mr. Henchy, “I think he’s travelling on his own account.... God forgive me,” he added, “I thought he was the dozen of stout.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Is there any chance of a drink itself?” asked Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I’m dry too,” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I asked that little shoeboy three times,” said Mr. Henchy, “would he send up a dozen of stout. I asked him again now, but he was leaning on the counter in his shirt-sleeves having a deep goster with Alderman Cowley.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Why didn’t you remind him?” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Well, I couldn’t go over while he was talking to Alderman Cowley. I just waited till I caught his eye, and said: ‘About that little matter I was speaking to you about....’ ‘That’ll be all right, Mr. H.,’ he said. Yerra, sure the little hop-o’-my-thumb has forgotten all about it.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“There’s some deal on in that quarter,” said Mr. O’Connor thoughtfully. “I saw the three of them hard at it yesterday at Suffolk Street corner.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I think I know the little game they’re at,” said Mr. Henchy. “You must owe the City Fathers money nowadays if you want to be made Lord Mayor. Then they’ll make you Lord Mayor. By God! I’m thinking seriously of becoming a City Father myself. What do you think? Would I do for the job?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. O’Connor laughed.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“So far as owing money goes....”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Driving out of the Mansion House,” said Mr. Henchy, “in all my vermin, with Jack here standing up behind me in a powdered wig&mdash;eh?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“And make me your private secretary, John.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Yes. And I’ll make Father Keon my private chaplain. We’ll have a family party.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Faith, Mr. Henchy,” said the old man, “you’d keep up better style than some of them. I was talking one day to old Keegan, the porter. ‘And how do you like your new master, Pat?’ says I to him. ‘You haven’t much entertaining now,’ says I. ‘Entertaining!’ says he. ‘He’d live on the smell of an oil-rag.’ And do you know what he told me? Now, I declare to God I didn’t believe him.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What?” said Mr. Henchy and Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“He told me: ‘What do you think of a Lord Mayor of Dublin sending out for a pound of chops for his dinner? How’s that for high living?’ says he. ‘Wisha! wisha,’ says I. ‘A pound of chops,’ says he, ‘coming into the Mansion House.’ ‘Wisha!’ says I, ‘what kind of people is going at all now?’”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">At this point there was a knock at the door, and a boy put in his head.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What is it?” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“From the Black Eagle,” said the boy, walking in sideways and depositing a basket on the floor with a noise of shaken bottles.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The old man helped the boy to transfer the bottles from the basket to the table and counted the full tally. After the transfer the boy put his basket on his arm and asked:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Any bottles?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What bottles?” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Won’t you let us drink them first?” said Mr. Henchy.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I was told to ask for the bottles.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Come back tomorrow,” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Here, boy!” said Mr. Henchy, “will you run over to O’Farrell’s and ask him to lend us a corkscrew&mdash;for Mr. Henchy, say. Tell him we won’t keep it a minute. Leave the basket there.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The boy went out and Mr. Henchy began to rub his hands cheerfully, saying:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Ah, well, he’s not so bad after all. He’s as good as his word, anyhow.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“There’s no tumblers,” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, don’t let that trouble you, Jack,” said Mr. Henchy. “Many’s the good man before now drank out of the bottle.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Anyway, it’s better than nothing,” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“He’s not a bad sort,” said Mr. Henchy, “only Fanning has such a loan of him. He means well, you know, in his own tinpot way.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The boy came back with the corkscrew. The old man opened three bottles and was handing back the corkscrew when Mr. Henchy said to the boy:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Would you like a drink, boy?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“If you please, sir,” said the boy.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The old man opened another bottle grudgingly, and handed it to the boy.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What age are you?” he asked.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Seventeen,” said the boy.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">As the old man said nothing further, the boy took the bottle and said: “Here’s my best respects, sir,” to Mr. Henchy, drank the contents, put the bottle back on the table and wiped his mouth with his sleeve. Then he took up the corkscrew and went out of the door sideways, muttering some form of salutation.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“That’s the way it begins,” said the old man.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“The thin edge of the wedge,” said Mr. Henchy.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The old man distributed the three bottles which he had opened and the men drank from them simultaneously. After having drunk each placed his bottle on the mantelpiece within hand’s reach and drew in a long breath of satisfaction.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Well, I did a good day’s work today,” said Mr. Henchy, after a pause.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“That so, John?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Yes. I got him one or two sure things in Dawson Street, Crofton and myself. Between ourselves, you know, Crofton (he’s a decent chap, of course), but he’s not worth a damn as a canvasser. He hasn’t a word to throw to a dog. He stands and looks at the people while I do the talking.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Here two men entered the room. One of them was a very fat man whose blue serge clothes seemed to be in danger of falling from his sloping figure. He had a big face which resembled a young ox’s face in expression, staring blue eyes and a grizzled moustache. The other man, who was much younger and frailer, had a thin, clean-shaven face. He wore a very high double collar and a wide-brimmed bowler hat.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Hello, Crofton!” said Mr. Henchy to the fat man. “Talk of the devil...”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Where did the boose come from?” asked the young man. “Did the cow calve?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, of course, Lyons spots the drink first thing!” said Mr. O’Connor, laughing.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Is that the way you chaps canvass,” said Mr. Lyons, “and Crofton and I out in the cold and rain looking for votes?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Why, blast your soul,” said Mr. Henchy, “I’d get more votes in five minutes than you two’d get in a week.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Open two bottles of stout, Jack,” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“How can I?” said the old man, “when there’s no corkscrew?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Wait now, wait now!” said Mr. Henchy, getting up quickly. “Did you ever see this little trick?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He took two bottles from the table and, carrying them to the fire, put them on the hob. Then he sat down again by the fire and took another drink from his bottle. Mr. Lyons sat on the edge of the table, pushed his hat towards the nape of his neck and began to swing his legs.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Which is my bottle?” he asked.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“This lad,” said Mr. Henchy.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Crofton sat down on a box and looked fixedly at the other bottle on the hob. He was silent for two reasons. The first reason, sufficient in itself, was that he had nothing to say; the second reason was that he considered his companions beneath him. He had been a canvasser for Wilkins, the Conservative, but when the Conservatives had withdrawn their man and, choosing the lesser of two evils, given their support to the Nationalist candidate, he had been engaged to work for Mr. Tiemey.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">In a few minutes an apologetic “Pok!” was heard as the cork flew out of Mr. Lyons’ bottle. Mr. Lyons jumped off the table, went to the fire, took his bottle and carried it back to the table.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“I was just telling them, Crofton,” said Mr. Henchy, “that we got a good few votes today.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Who did you get?” asked Mr. Lyons.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Well, I got Parkes for one, and I got Atkinson for two, and got Ward of Dawson Street. Fine old chap he is, too&mdash;regular old toff, old Conservative! ‘But isn’t your candidate a Nationalist?’ said he. ‘He’s a respectable man,’ said I. ‘He’s in favour of whatever will benefit this country. He’s a big ratepayer,’ I said. ‘He has extensive house property in the city and three places of business and isn’t it to his own advantage to keep down the rates? He’s a prominent and respected citizen,’ said I, ‘and a Poor Law Guardian, and he doesn’t belong to any party, good, bad, or indifferent.’ That’s the way to talk to ‘em.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“And what about the address to the King?” said Mr. Lyons, after drinking and smacking his lips.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Listen to me,” said Mr. Henchy. “What we want in this country, as I said to old Ward, is capital. The King’s coming here will mean an influx of money into this country. The citizens of Dublin will benefit by it. Look at all the factories down by the quays there, idle! Look at all the money there is in the country if we only worked the old industries, the mills, the ship-building yards and factories. It’s capital we want.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“But look here, John,” said Mr. O’Connor. “Why should we welcome the King of England? Didn’t Parnell himself...”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Parnell,” said Mr. Henchy, “is dead. Now, here’s the way I look at it. Here’s this chap come to the throne after his old mother keeping him out of it till the man was grey. He’s a man of the world, and he means well by us. He’s a jolly fine decent fellow, if you ask me, and no damn nonsense about him. He just says to himself: ‘The old one never went to see these wild Irish. By Christ, I’ll go myself and see what they’re like.’ And are we going to insult the man when he comes over here on a friendly visit? Eh? Isn’t that right, Crofton?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Crofton nodded his head.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“But after all now,” said Mr. Lyons argumentatively, “King Edward’s life, you know, is not the very...”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Let bygones be bygones,” said Mr. Henchy. “I admire the man personally. He’s just an ordinary knockabout like you and me. He’s fond of his glass of grog and he’s a bit of a rake, perhaps, and he’s a good sportsman. Damn it, can’t we Irish play fair?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“That’s all very fine,” said Mr. Lyons. “But look at the case of Parnell now.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“In the name of God,” said Mr. Henchy, “where’s the analogy between the two cases?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What I mean,” said Mr. Lyons, “is we have our ideals. Why, now, would we welcome a man like that? Do you think now after what he did Parnell was a fit man to lead us? And why, then, would we do it for Edward the Seventh?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“This is Parnell’s anniversary,” said Mr. O’Connor, “and don’t let us stir up any bad blood. We all respect him now that he’s dead and gone&mdash;even the Conservatives,” he added, turning to Mr. Crofton.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Pok! The tardy cork flew out of Mr. Crofton’s bottle. Mr. Crofton got up from his box and went to the fire. As he returned with his capture he said in a deep voice:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Our side of the house respects him, because he was a gentleman.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Right you are, Crofton!” said Mr. Henchy fiercely. “He was the only man that could keep that bag of cats in order. ‘Down, ye dogs! Lie down, ye curs!’ That’s the way he treated them. Come in, Joe! Come in!” he called out, catching sight of Mr. Hynes in the doorway.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Hynes came in slowly.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Open another bottle of stout, Jack,” said Mr. Henchy. “O, I forgot there’s no corkscrew! Here, show me one here and I’ll put it at the fire.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The old man handed him another bottle and he placed it on the hob.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Sit down, Joe,” said Mr. O’Connor, “we’re just talking about the Chief.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Ay, ay!” said Mr. Henchy.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Hynes sat on the side of the table near Mr. Lyons but said nothing.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“There’s one of them, anyhow,” said Mr. Henchy, “that didn’t renege him. By God, I’ll say for you, Joe! No, by God, you stuck to him like a man!”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, Joe,” said Mr. O’Connor suddenly. “Give us that thing you wrote&mdash;do you remember? Have you got it on you?”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, ay!” said Mr. Henchy. “Give us that. Did you ever hear that, Crofton? Listen to this now: splendid thing.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Go on,” said Mr. O’Connor. “Fire away, Joe.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Hynes did not seem to remember at once the piece to which they were alluding, but, after reflecting a while, he said:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“O, that thing is it.... Sure, that’s old now.”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Out with it, man!” said Mr. O’Connor.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“’Sh, ‘sh,” said Mr. Henchy. “Now, Joe!”</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Hynes hesitated a little longer. Then amid the silence he took off his hat, laid it on the table and stood up. He seemed to be rehearsing the piece in his mind. After a rather long pause he announced:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">THE DEATH OF PARNELL</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">6th October, 1891</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He cleared his throat once or twice and then began to recite:</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He is dead. Our Uncrowned King is dead.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">O, Erin, mourn with grief and woe</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">For he lies dead whom the fell gang</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Of modern hypocrites laid low.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He lies slain by the coward hounds</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He raised to glory from the mire;</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">And Erin’s hopes and Erin’s dreams</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Perish upon her monarch’s pyre.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">In palace, cabin or in cot</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The Irish heart where’er it be</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Is bowed with woe&mdash;for he is gone</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Who would have wrought her destiny.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He would have had his Erin famed,</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The green flag gloriously unfurled,</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Her statesmen, bards and warriors raised</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Before the nations of the World.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He dreamed (alas, ‘twas but a dream!)</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Of Liberty: but as he strove</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">To clutch that idol, treachery</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Sundered him from the thing he loved.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Shame on the coward, caitiff hands</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">That smote their Lord or with a kiss</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Betrayed him to the rabble-rout</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Of fawning priests&mdash;no friends of his.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">May everlasting shame consume</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The memory of those who tried</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">To befoul and smear the exalted name</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Of one who spurned them in his pride.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">He fell as fall the mighty ones,</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Nobly undaunted to the last,</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">And death has now united him</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">With Erin’s heroes of the past.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">No sound of strife disturb his sleep!</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Calmly he rests: no human pain</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Or high ambition spurs him now</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The peaks of glory to attain.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">They had their way: they laid him low.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">But Erin, list, his spirit may</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Rise, like the Phoenix from the flames,</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">When breaks the dawning of the day,</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">The day that brings us Freedom’s reign.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">One grief&mdash;the memory of Parnell.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Mr. Hynes sat down again on the table. When he had finished his recitation there was a silence and then a burst of clapping: even Mr. Lyons clapped. The applause continued for a little time. When it had ceased all the auditors drank from their bottles in silence.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">Pok! The cork flew out of Mr. Hynes’ bottle, but Mr. Hynes remained sitting flushed and bare-headed on the table. He did not seem to have heard the invitation.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“Good man, Joe!” said Mr. O’Connor, taking out his cigarette papers and pouch the better to hide his emotion.</span></p>

    <p class="Normal para-style-override-3"><span class="char-style-override-4">“What do you think of that, Crofton?” cried Mr. Henchy. “Isn’t that fine? What?”</span></p>
