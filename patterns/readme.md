LearnForward-Author CSS
---------

This is a CSS library designed to be used in the LearnForward-Author textbook build tool. Includes Bootstrap, FontAwesome, as well as an accompanying JavaScript to make certain components (such as the parallax class) behave properly. Like LFA itself, this library borrows structure and design from [Axis](https://github.com/jenius/axis).
