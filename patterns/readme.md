LearnForward-Author CSS
---------

This is a CSS+JS library designed to be used in the LearnForward-Author textbook build tool. Includes Bootstrap, FontAwesome, as well as an accompanying JavaScript to make certain components (such as the parallax class) behave properly. Like LFA itself, this library borrows structure and design from [Axis](https://github.com/jenius/axis).

### Developing / Testing

Install grunt if you don't have it with `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

Run `npm install`, then `grunt`.
